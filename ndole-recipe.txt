Prep time: 30 minutes
Cook time: 30 minutes
Total time: 1 hour
Serves: 4-6
You’ll need
2 cups of peeled groundnuts (also called peanuts)
3 cups of bitterleaf and/or spinach
Half teaspoon of baking SODA (for blanching vegetables)
1/4 cup crayfish- coarsely blended
2 pounds of boiled beef/beef feet/smoked fish/stock fish/shrimps
5 cloves of garlic
1 inch of ginger
1 maggi crevette (crayfish seasoning cube)
2 regular seasoning cubes (maggi or knorr)
1 large onion
1 cup of vegetable oil
1 habanero pepper (totally optional)

-I used a blend of dried bitterleaves and fresh spinach so I started out by
soaking my bitterleaf. So soak your bitterleaf if dried before blanching.
If using fresh bitterleaf, skip this stage.
-Put your groundnuts in a pot and let it boil. I purchase already peeled
groundnuts from the store. When boiling, put just enough water to slightly cook
the groundnuts so you do not have to throw any.
-If using shrimps, season them with a little salt (and white pepper if you wish)
and set aside to marinate.
-Chop up your spinach.
-Start the boiling and blanching process. Put water in a pot to boil and put in
salt and baking soda. The baking soda helps the vegetables retain their green
colour just like “Akangwa” or “Kangwa” (lime stone). However, I have read that
baking soda may harm some nutrients in vegetables so if that is a concern to
you, you may want to skip that. When water is boiled, put in bitterleaf and
stir. The baking soda of kangwa causes it to foam.
-Use the tip of your finger to check the bitterleaf for softness.
-If soft enough, add in the spinach and turn off the stove. Let it sit for TWO
minutes. If you leave the spinach in there for too long, it will get too soft
and you may not like it. So two minutes it is.
-Pour vegetable onto a strainer and immediately run cold water on it. If you do
not do this, the heat will continue to cook the vegetables much to your
disadvantage. When you have rinsed thoroughly, use both hands to roughly kill
the vegetables then you squeeze and keep in a bowl.
-Peel garlic and ginger and chop half of your onions then put in a blender plus
 your boiled groundnuts and pepper (if using).Blend to perfection and by
 perfection I don’t mean a very smooth paste like pap. It should be SLIGHTLY
 rough like ground egusi mixed with water.
-Go to the pot which contains your boiled meat and/or fish and its stock, bring
 to boil then add your blended groundnuts and bring to boil.
-Add in crayfish and stir.
-Then let the veggies go in.
-Give that a good mix, let it simmer for about 5 minutes and turn off the heat.
-Add in the maggi crevette seasoning cube and the other seasoning cubes.
Taste to ensure seasoning is balanced.
-Remember the left over half onion? Chop it up. Put oil to heat up in a skillet
and saute the onions.
-Add in the shrimps.
-The shrimps are done when they turn pink. Add them to your pot of vegetable and groundnuts.
-Ndole is ready!
-Serve with boiled plantains, boiled yams or miondo. You can even eat this with
boiled rice or garri.
